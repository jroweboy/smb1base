System palette modifier keys:
-----------------------------------------
New, speedy methods for picking subpalette colours have been added:
	
	-[Ctrl click] on a system colour to "ripple pick" a subpalette, that is, pick a colour for the currently active subpalette colour and automatically select the next one. 
	This is useful for picking a trio of colours for a subpalette much quicker. Ripple picking skips the backdrop colour when cycling through the subpalette. 
	-[Ctrl right-click] will skip a "ripple" without picking.
	
	-[Ctrl+Shift click] on a system colour to "ripple pick" up to a whole set of 4 subpalettes. Again, ripple picking skips "backdrop" entries.
	-[Ctrl+Shift right-click] will skip a "ripple" without picking; spanning all 4 subpalettes.

	-[Shift click] ripple-pick stepping a whole subpalette at a time. Useful for setting new colours in the same "tier", provided you've ordered your subpalette contents in tiers. 
 	-[Shift right-click] skip to the same position in the next subpalette.

	-[Alt click] on a system colour to quickly pick it as the backdrop colour (aka "common colour" or "colour 0"). Using this method, you don't need to preselect colour 0.
